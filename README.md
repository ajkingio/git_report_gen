# Git Report Generator
## Summary
This is a simple report generator for Git repositories. Right now it only generates a commit report but I may add more report options in the future.

## Usage
To use the Git Report Generator, simply run the following command:

```
./git_report_gen.py <repository_path> <time_range>
```

Time range should be in the format `1.week`, `2.months`, `3.years`, etc.
